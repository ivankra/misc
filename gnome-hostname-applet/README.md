# gnome-hostname-applet

A simple applet for GNOME Flashback that displays the hostname.

Useful, for example, when working with multiple virtual machines as a reminder of which particular VM you are working in now.

Installation: install .deb or compile and install from source with `make install`, Alt-Win-right click on an empty space in the GNOME panel, select "Add to Panel...", select "Hostname Applet". Alt-Win-right click on the added applet, select "Move" to move it to the desired location.
